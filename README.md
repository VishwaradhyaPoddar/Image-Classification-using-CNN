# Image-Classification-using-CNN
Welcome to the Image Classification using CNNs repository! This project demonstrates how to build, train, and evaluate a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification tasks. CNNs are a type of deep learning algorithm particularly well-suited for visual data and have proven to be highly effective in tasks such as object recognition, face detection, and medical image analysis.

Convolutional Neural Networks are a class of deep learning algorithms designed to process and analyze visual data. They are inspired by the visual cortex of animals and consist of multiple layers that transform the input image data into output labels through a series of convolutions, pooling, and fully connected layers.
