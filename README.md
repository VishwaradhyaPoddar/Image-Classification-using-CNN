# Image-Classification-using-CNN
Convolutional Neural Networks are a class of deep learning algorithms designed to process and analyze visual data. They are inspired by the visual cortex of animals and consist of multiple layers that transform the input image data into output labels through a series of convolutions, pooling, and fully connected layers.
